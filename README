Has this ever happened to you? You are typing a command and cannot remember 
whether that particular option is an "u" or an "o". cmdlinehelp to the 
rescue!

When editing a command line, press <c-o> (see also |g:cmdlinehelpMapView|) 
to display help on the command currently being edited.

Use <c-pageup>/<c-pagedown> to scroll the help window.

This plugin was inspired by a post by Marcel Boon to vim_use:
